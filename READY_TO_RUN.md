# Email Generator - READY TO RUN! ðŸš€

## What's Working:
âœ… Backend API with file upload validation
âœ… Celery task processing with OpenAI integration  
âœ… Full frontend with drag-and-drop upload
âœ… Progress tracking and download functionality
âœ… Docker setup for easy deployment

## How to Run:

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Make sure you have a .env file with:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key

# Start everything:
docker-compose up
```

### Option 2: Local Development
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start Redis:
redis-server

# Terminal 2 - Start Celery worker:
cd backend
celery -A tasks.celery_app worker --loglevel=info

# Terminal 3 - Start FastAPI:
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Access:
- Open http://localhost:8000
- Upload a CSV with columns like: name, company, role, email
- Wait for processing
- Download results!

## Test File Included:
- `test_prospects.csv` - Ready to upload and test

## What It Does:
1. Upload CSV/Excel file with prospect data
2. Generates personalized cold emails for each row
3. Returns Excel file with original data + generated emails

That's it! Bare bones but fully functional.
