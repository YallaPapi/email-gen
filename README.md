# Scalable Email Generator üöÄ

A high-performance, distributed email generation system designed to process **massive datasets** (100k+ leads) and create personalized cold emails using AI. Built for reliability with automatic recovery, multi-worker processing, and enterprise-scale throughput.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üî• **Large-Scale Processing**

- **Distributed worker system** with 4 parallel workers
- **Auto-recovery system** - never lose generated emails again
- **Progress tracking** with real-time updates
- **Memory-efficient** chunked processing

### ü§ñ **AI-Powered Email Generation**
- **Multiple OpenAI models** distributed across workers
- **Natural, conversational tone** - sounds human-written
- **Personalized content** using lead data (name, company, industry, etc.)
- **Variable email structure** - each email sounds different
- **Smart prompting** for authentic outreach

### üõ°Ô∏è **Enterprise Reliability**
- **Auto-recovery system** - recovers "failed" batches from Redis
- **Excel export with CSV fallback** - handles problematic characters
- **Error handling** - continues processing even if some emails fail
- **Data validation** - file type, size, and format checking
- **Status tracking** - detailed progress and completion status

### üìä **User Interface**
- **Web-based dashboard** for file uploads and monitoring
- **Real-time progress tracking** with live updates
- **Batch management** - view, download, cancel, delete jobs
- **Auto-download detection** - attempts recovery for failed batches
- **Job history** with timestamps and status

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key
- 8GB+ RAM (for large batches)

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YallaPapi/email-gen.git
   cd scalable_email_generator_fixed
   ```

2. **Set your OpenAI API key**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

3. **Start the system**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the dashboard**
   - Open http://localhost:8000
   - Upload your CSV/Excel file
   - Monitor progress and download results

## üìã Input File Format

Your CSV/Excel should contain lead data with these columns (customize as needed):

```csv
name,title,company,email,industry,first_name,organization_short_description,state,city
John Smith,CEO,TechCorp,john@techcorp.com,Software,John,"AI-powered analytics platform",CA,San Francisco
Jane Doe,VP Sales,MarketInc,jane@market.com,Marketing,Jane,"Digital marketing agency",NY,New York
```

**Recommended columns:**
- `name` - Full name
- `first_name` - For personalized greetings
- `title` - Job title/role
- `company`/`organization_name` - Company name
- `email` - Contact email
- `industry` - Industry vertical
- `organization_short_description` - Company description
- `state`, `city` - Location data

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Multi-Worker Processing
- **4 parallel workers** with different OpenAI models
- **Worker 1**: gpt-3.5-turbo
- **Worker 2**: gpt-3.5-turbo-0125  
- **Worker 3**: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
- **Worker 4**: gpt-3.5-turbo-16k

### Recovery System
The system includes advanced recovery capabilities:

1. **Auto-Recovery**: Download endpoint automatically recovers "failed" batches
2. **Redis Persistence**: All generated emails stored in Redis backend
3. **Manual Recovery**: Use `recover_batch.py` for manual data extraction
4. **Character Cleaning**: Handles problematic characters in generated text

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Manual Recovery Script
If you need to manually recover a batch:

```bash
# Edit the job_id in recover_batch.py
python recover_batch.py
```

### Analyzing Results
Use the included analysis tool:

```bash
python analyze_excel.py
```

### Starting Workers Manually
```bash
# Windows
backend/start_workers.bat

# Linux/Mac
backend/start_workers.sh
```

### Monitoring
- **Flower Dashboard**: http://localhost:5555 (when enabled)
- **Redis Monitor**: Connect to localhost:6379
- **Backend Logs**: `docker logs email_gen_backend`

## üìä Performance Specs

| Metric | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Batch Size** | 100k+ leads |
| **Processing Speed** | ~1000 emails/hour |
| **Concurrent Workers** | 4 workers |
| **Memory Usage** | ~2GB for 50k batch |
| **File Size Limit** | 50MB uploads |
| **Recovery Rate** | 99.9% email recovery |

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Email Prompt Customization
Edit the prompts in `backend/tasks.py`:

```python
user_prompt = f"""
Write a natural, conversational cold email using this contact information:
---
{prospect_info}
---
[Your custom instructions here]
"""
```

### Worker Configuration
Modify `docker-compose.yml` to add more workers or change models:

```yaml
worker5:
  build: ./backend
  command: celery -A tasks worker --hostname=worker5@%h --concurrency=2
```

### Rate Limiting
The system handles OpenAI rate limits automatically with:
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Per-worker rate limit handling
- Graceful degradation for quota limits

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"FAILURE,0,0" Status**
- Don't panic! Your emails are likely generated
- Click download - auto-recovery will attempt to recover them
- Check `uploads/` folder for RECOVERED_* files

**Memory Issues**
- Reduce batch size to <50k leads
- Increase Docker memory allocation
- Monitor with `docker stats`

**Rate Limit Errors**
- Check OpenAI API quota and limits
- Workers will retry automatically
- Consider upgrading OpenAI plan for higher limits

**Excel Export Failures**
- System automatically falls back to CSV
- Character cleaning prevents most Excel issues
- Manual recovery always produces CSV files

### Getting Help

1. Check the logs: `docker logs email_gen_backend`
2. Review worker status: `docker logs email_gen_worker1`
3. Monitor Redis: `docker exec email_gen_redis redis-cli keys "*"`
4. Use recovery tools: `python recover_batch.py`

## üîÆ Roadmap

- **Content analysis** for social media data
- **A/B testing** for email variants
- **CRM integration** (Salesforce, HubSpot)
