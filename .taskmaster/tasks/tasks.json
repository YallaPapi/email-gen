        "title": "Design Comprehensive FastAPI CSV Upload Testing Strategy",
        "description": "Develop a robust and thorough testing strategy for CSV upload endpoints in a FastAPI application, ensuring correctness, security, and resilience.",
        "details": "1. **Test Coverage**: Define test cases for valid and invalid CSV uploads, including edge cases (e.g., empty files, malformed CSV, large files, missing headers, incorrect data types).\n\n2. **Testing Tools**: Use `pytest` with `httpx.AsyncClient` for asynchronous endpoint testing. Employ `pytest-asyncio` for async test support. Consider using `pytest-mock` or `unittest.mock` for mocking file I/O and database interactions.\n\n3. **Test Types**:\n- *Unit tests*: Validate CSV parsing logic, file validation, and error handling in isolation.\n- *Integration tests*: Simulate full upload requests to the FastAPI endpoint, verifying end-to-end behavior, including file storage and database insertion.\n- *Security tests*: Check for vulnerabilities such as path traversal, file type spoofing, and denial-of-service with large files.\n- *Performance tests*: Measure upload throughput and response times for large or concurrent uploads.\n\n4. **Fixtures and Test Data**: Create reusable fixtures for sample CSV files (valid and invalid), temporary upload directories, and mock database connections.\n\n5. **Validation**: Ensure tests assert correct HTTP status codes, error messages, and data persistence. Use parameterized tests to cover multiple scenarios efficiently.\n\n6. **CI Integration**: Integrate tests into the CI pipeline to ensure all CSV upload features are automatically verified on each commit.\n\n7. **Documentation**: Document the testing approach, coverage, and how to run tests locally and in CI environments.\n\nExample integration test snippet:\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom httpx import AsyncClient\n\n@pytest.mark.asyncio\nasync def test_upload_valid_csv(async_client: AsyncClient):\n    files = {'file': ('test.csv', b'header1,header2\\nval1,val2', 'text/csv')}\n    response = await async_client.post('/upload/single', files=files)\n    assert response.status_code == 200\n    assert response.json()['filename'] == 'test.csv'\n```\n",
        "testStrategy": "- Run all unit and integration tests using pytest, ensuring 100% coverage of CSV upload logic and endpoints.\n- Verify that uploads of valid CSV files succeed and data is correctly processed or stored.\n- Confirm that invalid or malicious files are rejected with appropriate error responses.\n- Test edge cases (empty, malformed, oversized files) and assert correct handling.\n- Use static analysis and security scanning tools to check for vulnerabilities in file handling.\n- Review CI pipeline logs to ensure tests run and pass automatically on each commit.",

        "title": "Fix Celery Chord Callback Hanging in Email Sequence Generation",
        "description": "Resolve issues with Celery chord callback hanging in the email sequence generation workflow by implementing ignore_result=False, configuring a reliable result backend, and adding robust production-grade error handling based on TaskMaster research.",
        "details": "1. **Set ignore_result=False**: Ensure all tasks participating in the chord (both header and callback) are defined with `ignore_result=False`. For decorated tasks, use `@app.task(ignore_result=False)`. For class-based tasks, set `ignore_result = False` in the class definition. This is critical, as Celery chords require result tracking to function correctly[4].\n\n2. **Configure Result Backend**: Verify that the Celery application is configured with a reliable result backend (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ, or a database). Update the Celery configuration (e.g., in `celeryconfig.py` or equivalent) to set `result_backend` to a production-ready backend. Avoid using the default or in-memory backends in production, as they do not persist results and can cause chord synchronization failures[4].\n\n3. **Production-Ready Error Handling**:\n   - Implement error callbacks using the `link_error` option to capture and handle exceptions in both header and callback tasks. Define a dedicated error handler task (e.g., `@app.task(bind=True)`) that logs errors, sends notifications, or triggers compensating actions as needed[3].\n   - Ensure that all exceptions in the chord workflow are logged with sufficient context (task name, arguments, traceback).\n   - Optionally, implement retry logic for transient failures in the chord callback, using Celery's built-in retry mechanisms.\n\n4. **Testing and Monitoring**:\n   - Add instrumentation or logging to monitor the status of chord execution and callback completion.\n   - Document the configuration and error handling patterns for future maintainers.\n\n5. **Code Example**:\n```python\n@app.task(ignore_result=False)\ndef send_email_task(email_data):\n    # ...\n\n@app.task(ignore_result=False)\ndef email_sequence_callback(results):\n    # ...\n\n@app.task(bind=True)\ndef chord_error_handler(self, request, exc, traceback):\n    logger.error(f\"Task {request.id} failed: {exc}\")\n\nheader = [send_email_task.s(data) for data in email_batch]\nchord(header)(email_sequence_callback.s()).apply_async(link_error=chord_error_handler.s())\n```\n\n6. **Documentation**: Update internal documentation to reflect the new configuration and error handling approach.",
        "testStrategy": "- Write unit and integration tests to verify that chords execute successfully and the callback is triggered as expected when all header tasks complete.\n- Simulate failures in header and callback tasks to confirm that the error handler is invoked and errors are logged or handled appropriately.\n- Test with the configured result backend to ensure results are persisted and retrieved correctly.\n- Monitor logs and Celery events during test runs to verify that no chord callbacks hang and all tasks complete or fail gracefully.\n- Review Celery worker logs for any warnings or errors related to result backend or ignored results.",
